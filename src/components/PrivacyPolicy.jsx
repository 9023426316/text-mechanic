        <p>Many critics have attacked the efficacy and legitimacy of privacy policies found on the Internet. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of industry-regulated privacy policies. For example, a 2000 FTC report Privacy Online: Fair Information Practices in the Electronic Marketplace found that while the vast majority of websites surveyed had some manner of privacy disclosure, most did not meet the standard set in the FTC Principles. In addition, many organizations reserve the express right to unilaterally change the terms of their policies. In June 2009 the EFF website TOSback began tracking such changes on 56 popular internet services, including monitoring the privacy policies of Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p>
        <p>There are also questions about whether consumers understand privacy policies and whether they help consumers make more informed decisions. A 2002 report from the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab contended that a website's visual designs had more influence than the website's privacy policy when consumers assessed the website's credibility.[51] A 2007 study by Carnegie Mellon University claimed "when not presented with prominent privacy information..." consumers were "â€¦likely to make purchases from the vendor with the lowest price, regardless of that site's privacy policies".[52] However, the same study also showed that when information about privacy practices is clearly presented, consumers prefer retailers who better protect their privacy and some are willing to "pay a premium to purchase from more privacy protective websites". Furthermore, a 2007 study at the University of California, Berkeley found that "75% of consumers think as long as a site has a privacy policy it means it won't share data with third parties," confusing the existence of a privacy policy with extensive privacy protection.[53] Based on the common nature of this misunderstanding, researcher Joseph Turow argued to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that the term "privacy policy" thus constitutes a deceptive trade practice and that alternative phrasing like "how we use your information" should be used instead.</p>
        <p>Privacy policies suffer generally from a lack of precision, especially when compared with the emerging form of the Data Use Statement. Where privacy statements provide a more general overview of data collection and use, data use statements represent a much more specific treatment. As a result, privacy policies may not meet the increased demand for transparency that data use statements provide.</p>
        <p>Critics also question if consumers even read privacy policies or can understand what they read. A 2001 study by the Privacy Leadership Initiative claimed only 3% of consumers read privacy policies carefully, and 64% briefly glanced at, or never read privacy policies.[55] The average website user once having read a privacy statement may have more uncertainty about the trustworthiness of the website than before.[56][57] One possible issue is length and complexity of policies. According to a 2008 Carnegie Mellon study, the average length of a privacy policy is 2,500 words and requires an average of 10 minutes to read. The study cited that "Privacy policies are hard to read" and, as a result, "read infrequently".[58] However, any efforts to make the information more presentable simplify the information to the point that it does not convey the extent to which users' data is being shared and sold.[59] This is known as the "transparency paradox".</p>
        <p>There have been many studies carried out by researchers to evaluate the privacy policies of the websites of companies. One study uses natural language processing and deep learning as a proposed solution to automatically assess the efficiency of companies' privacy policies, in order to help the users become more aware.</p>

        <p>In 1995 the European Union (EU) introduced the Data Protection Directive[6] for its member states. As a result, many organizations doing business within the EU began to draft policies to comply with this Directive. In the same year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published the Fair Information Principles[7] which provided a set of non-binding governing principles for the commercial use of personal information. While not mandating policy, these principles provided guidance of the developing concerns of how to draft privacy policies.</p>
        <p>The United States does not have a specific federal regulation establishing universal implementation of privacy policies. Congress has, at times, considered comprehensive laws regulating the collection of information online, such as the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act[8] and the Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001,[9] but none have been enacted. In 2001, the FTC stated an express preference for "more law enforcement, not more laws"[10] and promoted continued focus on industry self-regulation.</p>
        <p>In many cases, the FTC enforces the terms of privacy policies as promises made to consumers using the authority granted by Section 5 of the FTC Act which prohibits unfair or deceptive marketing practices.[11] The FTC's powers are statutorily restricted in some cases; for example, airlines are subject to the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),[12] and cell phone carriers are subject to the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p>

        <p>In some cases, private parties enforce the terms of privacy policies by filing class action lawsuits, which may result in settlements or judgments. However, such lawsuits are often not an option, due to arbitration clauses in the privacy policies or other terms of service agreements. </p>
